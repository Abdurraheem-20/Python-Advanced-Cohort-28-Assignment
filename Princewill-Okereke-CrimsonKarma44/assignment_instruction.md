**File Handling**



**Classwork**



* **The program should keep a file called visitors.txt**
* **Each time it runs, it should:**

**  - Ask the user for the visitor's name.**

**- Before adding name, check the last line in the file**

**- If it's the same name, raise a custom exception DuplicateVisitorError.**

**- Otherwise, add the name with a timestamp.**



* **If the file does not exist, create it.**
* **Use with statement**
* **Handle errors gracefully and make sure the program doesn't crash.**



**Assignment**
